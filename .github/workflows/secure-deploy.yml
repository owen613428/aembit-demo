        ## Security Transformation Achieved
        
        ### Zero Secrets Deployment
        - ✅ No secrets in application source code
        - ✅ No secrets in CI/CD environment variables
        - ✅ No secrets in deployment configurations
        
        ### Aembit Integration Success
        - ✅ GitHub OIDC workload identity established
        - ✅ Just-in-time credential delivery configured
        - ✅ Automatic credential lifecycle management enabled
        
        ### Security Improvements
        
        | Security Aspect | Before Aembit | After Aembit |
        |----------------|---------------|--------------|
        | Secrets in Code | ❌ Hardcoded | ✅ Zero secrets |
        | CI/CD Security | ❌ Secrets in logs | ✅ OIDC only |
        | Developer Access | ❌ All secrets visible | ✅ No secret access |
        | Audit Trail | ❌ Limited | ✅ Complete audit |
        
        ## Next Steps
        
        1. Monitor deployment in Aembit console
        2. Verify applications for functionality  
        3. Review audit logs for compliance
