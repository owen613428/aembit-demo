## üö® DEMO ENVIRONMENT ONLY üö®

This repository contains **intentionally vulnerable code** for demonstration purposes only.

### What This Repository Contains

- **Vulnerable applications** with hardcoded secrets (for demo purposes)
- **Secure applications** using Aembit for credential management
- **GitHub Actions workflows** showing CI/CD security transformation
- **Fake credentials** that are never real and only used for demonstration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**: This code contains intentional security vulnerabilities
2. **FAKE CREDENTIALS ONLY**: All secrets in this repo are fake and for demo purposes
3. **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE**: This demonstrates what NOT to do vs. secure practices
4. **NOT FOR REAL APPLICATIONS**: Use this only to understand Aembit's security benefits

### What You Should Do

- ‚úÖ Use this to understand CI/CD security risks
- ‚úÖ Learn how Aembit eliminates secrets from code
- ‚úÖ See the security transformation in action
- ‚úÖ Reference the secure implementation patterns

### What You Should NOT Do

- ‚ùå Deploy this code to any production environment
- ‚ùå Use any of the credentials shown (they're all fake anyway)
- ‚ùå Copy the vulnerable patterns for real applications
- ‚ùå Store real secrets in any repository
